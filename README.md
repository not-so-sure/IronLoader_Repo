## **You need nodejs for this to work!**
https://nodejs.org

After installing run these commands in command prompt:

node -v

npm -v

You should have strings of numbers outputted

## Create a new folder somewhere and cd to it
then type in the console:

npm init -y

this makes the package.json that you will need to overwrite / replace

Then run:

npm install electron --save-dev

And then paste the downloaded files into the new folder you created.

It should be as simple as running: 

npm start
